                        Arpitha also does a good job of documenting her work, anticipating questions and providing her reasoning for various decisions made when completing an assignment. 
                        Working with Arpitha is drama and worry free. She will be a good addition to any team."</b></i>

                          Her ability to go out of her way to help others has made her stand out. 
                         Thanks a lot, Arpitha! You made the transition smooth and more comfortable.

                         I'm very pleased to recommend Arpitha. As a fellow student at Visvesvaraya Technological University and collegue at TCS, I've worked alongside Arpitha and I have known her for the past six years. 
                         Not only has she been a key player on our team, but she's also become a very close personal friend. Arpitha's skills and leadership qualities would make her an invaluable addition to IT company. 
                         She is enthusiastic, humble and honest. She is a great public speaker as well.
                         While Arpitha has found success at TCS, helping the team to complete the tasks as per the requirements of clients over her time here, she's looking to maximize her skills as a leader within a larger company.
                         Arpitha is poised to step into a role of her dream for IT with the potential for global reach. She is dedicated, hard working, intelligent, competent and a capable young lady. 
                         In the years I have known her she has demonstrated exceptional skills and competence.
                         Arpitha has my highest recommendation.
